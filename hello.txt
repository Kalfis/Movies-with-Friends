Hi Luis & Will!

It's Maggie! I'm sending this from my local maggie branch to a github maggie branch (even though at the moment I'm writing this, there is no Maggie branch.)

This is Luis.  Just made a change in my personal branche, merged it into my develop branch and pushed it to Git Hub develop branch.
